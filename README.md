## Disclaimer
Note that this project is only a unversity project with its target audience meant for medical heart students and assist practising professionals. Refinement is still needed for the algorithms. The app should provide a somewhat accurate result of the diagnosis if the heart sound recorded is clear. However, this should not be your final diagnosis and always seek advice from your doctor.
